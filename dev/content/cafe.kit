                When we conceptualized Vault + Vine, we wanted to create a space where both our guests and staff would feel at home. 
                Located in the heart of East Falls, our café is the perfect place to 
                unwind, meet a friend, or catch up on some work.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Stop by and enjoy our offerings from a variety of local vendors, including coffee from Triangle Roasters; 
                tea from The Random Tea Room and pastries from Au Fournil French Artisan Bakery, and Crust Vegan Bakery. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The café is open from 8a-3p Thursday through Sunday.
